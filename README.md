## About this Project
-Every Developer loves talking about new discoveries and saying why the programing language he knows is the best.

-Due to this, i developed a tech-blog website that is deployed in heroku that allows users to sign in, talk and share discoveries of their coding life.

-This in turn makes a fun environment for developers or people who want to become developers. So that they can argue, work and become better developers.
